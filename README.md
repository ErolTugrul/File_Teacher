The purpose of this project is to read, understand and answer questions about .pdf or .docx files the user has uploaded. You can upload your files and ask specific questions about anything that is mentioned in your file.

The app is working on text-only files for now but i am intending to extend it's capabilities to work with the same efficiency with tables, images and various file types in the future.
